Sometimes you might need to test Laravel mails using the command line, to see if they are being sent/received, use this method to simplify testing.

I will often use Tinkerwell and HELO for this but you can also use ```php artisan tinker``` and your regular email client.

Simply paste in the following snippet and update the email address to send the email:

```bash
Mail::raw('Test Mail', function($msg) {
    $msg->to('email@example.com')->subject('Test Mail');
});
```

If you are on PHP 7.4 +, you can simplify the above using short arrow functions:

```bash
Mail::raw('Test Mail', fn($msg) => $msg->to('email@example.com')->subject('Test Mail'));
```

After running the above snippet you will receive an email if everything has worked correctly:

<Image src={successfulEmail} alt="" />
